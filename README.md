This banking system allows users to deposit and withdraw from their personal account.
Every operation performed on the account is automatically recorded and stored in the system. 
In addition, all transactions are carefully controlled to ensure the correctness of the operation.
Due to the need to perform multiple operations at the same time (multithreading) 
in this system, concurrency management mechanisms are used to avoid problems such as data competition or unauthorized access to resources.
